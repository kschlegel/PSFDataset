class Compose:
    """
    A class to allow chaining of transformations.

    Takes a list of transformations to be applied to the data consecutively.
    This is currently intendened to only be used once to chain several
    transformations, do not recurse compositions (recursive applications should
    still apply transformations correctly, but will break the description dict.
    This may be fixed at a later time).

    Methods
    -------
    get_desc()
        Return a dictionary describing the properties of the transformations.

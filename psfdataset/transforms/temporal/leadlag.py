    forms tuples of path elements, advancing time one component at a time.

    The path 1,2,3 with delay 2 turns into

class MultiDelayedTransformation:
    """
    Compute the multi-delayed transformation of a path.

    Expects an array of the form [element][frame][coords]. This is a variant of
    the lead-lag transformation which instead of advancing time one component
    at a time it advances time by one in each component every step so that each
    element of the multi-delayed path contains the last delay elements of the
    original path. Pads with zeros at the ends.

    The path 1,2,3 with delay 1 turns into
